Machine Learning Assignments in the course CS-725, under Prof. Sunita Sarawagi in IIT Bombay in Autumn Semester 2019-20

#Assignment 1 :
A Simple Linear Regression Model to predict the Bike Rental count using the Bike Rental Dataset from Kaggle,implementated 
from scratch, using 4 different loss functions and their relative performance:

  i) Mean squared Loss

  ii) Root Mean Squared Loss
  
  iii) log_cosh loss
  
   iv) Mean Absolute Loss

#Assignment 2 : 
A Simple Feed Forward Neural Network Model implemented from scratch(including Forward and Backward Propagation) for two 
classification tasks:-

  a) XOR Dataset 
  
  b) MNIST digit recognition Dataset
  
using two different Activation functions and their relative performances :-
  i) ReLU Activation
  
  ii) Sigmoid Activation
